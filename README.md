This extension allows you to enable a custom subset of MediaEmbed sites provided by Flarum's TextFormatter.

The list of sites and their templates are not managed by this extension, they come bundled with [s9e/TextFormatter](https://github.com/s9e/TextFormatter/).

You can use this extension at the same time as [FoF Formatting](https://github.com/FriendsOfFlarum/formatting), but you should not enable MediaEmbed in FoF Formatting when doing so.

The configuration only applies to new posts.
Older posts must be edited for the new configuration to be used (both to add or remove stale embeds).

## Installation

    composer require clarkwinkelmann/flarum-ext-selective-mediaembed

## Support

This extension is under **minimal maintenance**.

It was developed for a client and released as open-source for the benefit of the community.
I might publish simple bugfixes or compatibility updates for free.

You can [contact me](https://clarkwinkelmann.com/flarum) to sponsor additional features or updates.

Support is offered on a "best effort" basis through the Flarum community thread.
